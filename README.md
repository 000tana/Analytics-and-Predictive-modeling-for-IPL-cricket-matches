# Analytics and Predictive-modeling for PL cricket matches
### Programming Language: Python 3.6
### IDE: Jupyter Notebook(Azure Big Data)
### input: CSV file
### Output: Predictive Model of Machine learning using scikit learn module, statistical data analytics with graphs using Numpy,Matplotlib

We use Kaggle IPL matches.csv attached with the project in ..\data\matches.csv. The data analytics is performed to compare features that 
affect the outcomes of matches like 'city','toss_decision','toss_winner','venue'. A predictive model is developed using Machine Learning algorithm to get highest possible accuracy. Then feature importance is defined with predictive machine learning model applied and compared against actual data statistics. Here RandomForestClassifier is used as it gave 88% accuracy.
